//! ezvpn
//!
//! IP-over-QUIC VPN tunnel via iroh P2P connections.
//! Uses ed25519 client keypairs for access control and TLS 1.3/QUIC for
//! encryption.
//!
//! This is the library crate. The desktop CLI (`src/main.rs`) and the Apple
//! Network Extension FFI (`src/ffi.rs`, built into a `staticlib`) both consume
//! it. Desktop platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows) get the full client/server with
//! TUN creation, routing, single-instance lock, and the control socket. Apple
//! app extensions get the portable data plane (iroh connect + handshake +
//! data-stream loop) and drive an OS-provided `utun` fd — routing and IP
//! configuration are owned by the `NEPacketTunnelProvider`, not this crate.
